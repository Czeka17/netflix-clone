I used these technologies: **Mongodb, Reactjs, tailwindcss, TypeScript, Nextjs** 

**Moowiz is a Netflix clone app where users can watch trailers of movies they want, add movies to their list, like them, and search for specific movies within the app.**

**While I was making this page, I learned how to use Tailwind CSS, NextAuth, and how to create and integrate my first APIs.**
